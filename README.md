# Ruby Misc.

A collection of methods and projects built to practice Ruby.

## 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

This bubble sort algorithm orders a list of randomized integers from smallest to largest. It is optimized to only check n-1 elements, where n is the number of pass throughs, since the largest unsorted integer always "bubbles" to the top on each pass through. It also also optimized to recognize if the list is sorted before all pass throughs have been completed.

## 2. Caesar Cipher

Creates a Caesar cipher from a string and an integer.

A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

## 3. Custom Enumerables

Recreating some of Ruby's built-in enumerablesâ€”methods for searching, traversal, and sorting collectionsâ€”to gain a deeper understanding of blocks and procs.

## 4. Event Manager

A tutorial from the Odin Project to practice Ruby I/O and Google APIs.

The goal is to find the government representatives of each attendee of an upcoming event based on their zip code. The information for the attendees is contained in a CSV and needs to be checked for validity. Using their address and the GoogleCivic API, the government representatives are then appended to an ERB template.

## 5. Linked List

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is the result of each element points to the next. 

In this basic linked list every node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The LinkedList class contains a variety of methods to add and delete nodes and search for specific indexes and data within the list.

## 6. Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer (recursive) sorting algorithm.

First the array is divided into the smallest unit (1 element), then each element is compared with the adjacent list to sort and the two adjacent lists are merged. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.

## 10. Typing Practice

Typing practice for beginners.

Choose a category (i.e. fruits) and then practice typing words from that category (apple, banana, etc.). When a mistake is made the user is prompted to retry typing the word.
